    <h1>Spider-Man</h1>
    <p><b>Spider-Man</b> is the alias of Peter Parker, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webbing of his own design. </p>
